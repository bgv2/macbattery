# macbattery
A Mac app (made with Electron) that shows battery stats.

The app is currently unfinished and bloated (due to its use of Electron).
If you actually need a battery stats app for your Mac, use [coconutBattery](https://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/).
Or, use `ioreg -brc AppleSmartBattery` in the Terminal.
